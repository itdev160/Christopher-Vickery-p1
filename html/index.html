          Formula 1 moved on to Germany this week to take on a track not seen in
          the championship sense 2013. To add to the challenge of the
          Nurburgring cold weather and rain added acted to cool some spirits. On
          Friday heavy fog and rain grounded the medial helicopters causing the
          cancellation of both free practice one and two. The low clouds and
          rain cleared up on saturday, allowing both the morning practice
          session and qualifying take place without a hitch.

        <h3>A week, and weekend of surprises off the race track.</h3>

        <p>
          This week brought Formula one some sad news. Honda, engin pattern to
          both Red Bull and Alphatauri has decided to leave the F1 family once
          again after the 2021 season. This comes as a shock to many with how
          well both teams have done this season. Honda claims that the decision
          only has to do with a push towards a more sustainable approach to
          their car design, but one can not help but think that the current
          world condition must have some effect. Either way Red Bull and its
          sister team are left to find a new engine supplier, or take up the
          rumored plan to buy faculties from Honda to continue to project.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sickness struck for one driver this weekend. Racing Points' Lance
          Stroll found himself unable to take part in the festivities due to
          gastrointestinal distress. Nico Hulkenberg got the call up once again
          to fill the seat. Lucky living relatively close to the track meant a
          man who was literally drinking coffee with friends on saturday morning
          could get through the covid prescreening in time to make it to
          qualifying. The lack of practice sessions for him lead to a last place
          qualification, but considering the circumstances being less the one
          second off the back is commendable.
        </p>

        <h3 class="clear">Race Day: cold with a chance of engin problems</h3>
        <p>
          Like much of the weekend Sunday proved a cold one, at 8&deg; (nearly
          lowest temperature race on record) tire management proved to be a
          large problem for many drivers. The race proved eventful form the
          start with the mercedes trading places twice in the first lap. Daniel
          Ricciardo rapidly passed both Alex Albon and Charles Leclerc, which
          allowed him to inherit third when Valtteri Bottas ran into power unit
          troubles.
        </p>
        <img
          class="pics float-right"
          src="../img/fh8p9x3zehs51.jpg"
          alt="Lewis Hamiltion on the podium with Michael Schumacher"
        />
        <p>
          The drive with the worst luck for the day could probably be considered
          Albon. Forced into an early pitstop lead to him being near the back
          behind Dannill Kvyat. A poorly planed passing attempt lead to him
          clipping Kvyat front wing leading to a penalty and latter a pierced
          radiator forced an early withdrawal from the race. Lando Norris and
          Esteban Ocan also found them selves exiting early with hydraulic and
          power unit problems respectively, along with George Russell who's
          suspension broke after a run in with Kimi Raikkonen.
        </p>

        <h3>Lucky and History</h3>
        <p>
          The big winners this weekend were hands down Danile Ricciardo and Nico
          Hulkenberg. Hulkenbergs last to eight drive was a thing of beauty and
          shows that he deserves a full time seat once again. Renault had their
          best weekend in nearly a decade with Daniel Ricciardo delivering their
          first podium sense the team rejoin F1. But the biggest piece of
          history lands on the shoulders of Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton's 91st win
          ties him with Michael Schumacher for most wins in the championship.
          The achievement could be considered even more appropriate with the
          tieing takeing place at a track Schumacher won at 5 times. In a
          touching moment Mich Schumacher presented Lewis with a race helmet his
          farther had worn in a race at the Nurburgring. With another record in
          the books, let along the likening tieing of Schumachers championship
          winning record, Hamiltion has once again proven him self as one of the
          best drivers to ever grace a track.
