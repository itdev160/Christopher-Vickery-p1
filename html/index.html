          Formula 1 moved on to Germany this week to take on a track not seen in
          the chamipnship sense 2013. To add to the chalage of the Nurburgring
          cold weather and rain added acted to cool some spirts. On Friday heavy
          fog and rain grounded the medial helicoptrs causeing the cancilation
          of both free practaice one and two. The low clouds and rain cleared up
          on saturday, allowing both the morning practice session and quilifying
          take place without a hitch.

        <h3>A week, and weekend of suprises off the race track.</h3>

        <p>
          This week grough Formula one some sad news. Honda, engin partern to
          both Red Bull and Alphatauri has descied to leave the F1 family once
          again after the 2021 seson. This comes as a shock to many with the
          high sucese of both teams this year. Honda claims that the descion
          only has to do with a push twoards a more sistanable aproch to their
          car desigh, but one can not help but think that the current world
          condition must have some effect. Either way Red Bull and its sister
          team left to find a new engion suplier, or take up the rummered plan
          of buy faclties from Honda to contiune to project.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sickness struck for one driver this weekend. Racing Points' Lance
          Stroll found himself unable to take part in the festivites due to
          gastro instal destress. Nico Hulkenberg got the call up once again to
          fill the seat. Luckly liveing realativly close to the track meant a
          man who was litterly drinking coffie with freinds on saturday morning
          could get trhough the covid prescreening in time to make it to
          quilifying. The lack of practice sesions for him lead to a last place
          qulifaciton, but considering the cicumsances being less the one second
          off the back is comendable.
        </p>

        <h3 class="clear">Race Day: cold with a chance of engin problems</h3>
        <p>
          Like much of the weekend Sunday proved a cold one, at 8&deg; (nearly
          lowest tempature race on recond) tire mangement proved to be a large
          problem for many drivers. The race proved eventful form the start with
          the mercedes trading places twice in the first lap. Daniel Ricciardo
          rapidly passed both Alex Albon and Charles Leclerc, which alowed him
          to inharite third when Valtteri Bottas ran into power unit troubles.
        </p>
        <img
          class="pics float-right"
          src="../img/fh8p9x3zehs51.jpg"
          alt="Lewis Hamiltion on the podium with Michael Schumacher"
        />
        <p>
          The drive with the worst luck for the day could probally be considered
          Albon. Forced into an early pitstop lead to him being near the back
          bhind Dannill Kvyat. A poorly planed passing atempt lead to him
          cliping Kvyat front wing leading to a penalty and latter a peired
          raditer forced an early withdrawl from the race. Lando Norris and
          Esteban Ocan also found them selfves exiting early with hydraulic and
          power unit problmes respetivly, along with George Russell who's
          suspention broke after a run in with Kimi Raikkonen.
        </p>

        <h3>Lucky and History</h3>
        <p>
          The big winners this weekend were hands down Danile Ricciardo and Nico
          Hulkenberg. Hulkenbergs last to eight drive was a thing of beuity and
          shows that he deserves a full time seat once again. Renault had their
          best weekend in nearly a decade with Daniel Ricciardo delivering their
          first podium sense the team rejoin F1. But the biggest piece of
          histroy lands on the sholders of Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton's 91st win
          ties him with Michael Schumacher for most wins in the chamiponship.
          The achivment could be considered even more aporate with the tieing
          takeing palce at a track Schumacher won at 5 times. In a touching
          moment Mich Schumacher presented Lewis with a race helment his farther
          had worn in a race at the Nurburgring. With another record in the
          books, let along the likeing tieing of Schumachers championship
          winning record, Hamiltion has once again proven him self as one of the
          best drivers to ever grace a track.
